# ===========================
# ZERO-BAIL DDD EVENT STUDY (Synthetic)
# - Accurate statewide dates (Apr 13, 2020 -> Jun 20, 2020)

### A note on the weight module
# We weight the regression by the number of arrests in each county-week-offense-race-gender cell.
# This follows the PPIC report’s approach and improves efficiency when modeling rates.
# Cells with more arrests produce more precise rearrest rate estimates than cells with very few arrests.
# Without weighting, small, noisy cells could distort results by contributing equally to large, precise cells.
# Weighting ensures the estimated effects reflect the population in proportion to its size, 
# giving more influence to precise observations and aligning the analysis with real-world sample structure.
